I am a researcher and engineer who enjoys studying the behaviour of systems (computational, social, cognitive, etc.) and optimizing them.

Currently, I am involved in engineering and research pertaining to scalable and high-performance machine learning systems, continually pushing the boundaries of what's possible in these fields. During my free time, I enjoy exploring new technologies and reading up concepts in computer science, psychology, and mathematics.
